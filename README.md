# Client

This is a phone number generator user interface.

The project is built using the following:

--Vite <br />

# Get Started

To get client app running, execute the following commands:

1. `git clone git@github.com:MembaMcetywa/so-many-numbers.git`
2. `cd client`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

At this point the client should be running successfully. Please continue to setup the backend app here:
`https://github.com/MembaMcetywa/backend/blob/main/README.md`

This should show you an entry of the mongodb container in the list of running containers. This check confirms to us whether or not the container is running successfully.

Should you wish to you stop the container from running, execute the following command:

`docker compose down`
